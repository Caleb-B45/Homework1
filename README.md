# Homework1
//First I uploaded the code for the first problem using git commit. Then I uploaded the second code using git commit. 

Code 1: 
The first code compares the time it takes to add doubles vs the time it takes to add floats. The code generates an array of random doubles and then it converts the doubles that it generated into floats. 
When the code runs, the time that it run the code shows up in milliseconds. Then the program calculates and prints the ratio of ticks for doubles over floats. 
The ratio usually changes after every run but adding two floats together is usually quicker than adding two doubles together.

Code 2:
The second code compares the time it takes to square a set of random numbers using multiplication, Math.Pow, and Math.Sqrt. 
The code generated random numbers and then squares the random numbers using the 3 different methods. It then shows the time it takes to perform each method in milliseconds. 
Then it calculates and prints the ratio of ticks. Using direct multiplication to compute a square is faster than using Math.Pow and Math.Sqrt. 
This is probably because it is simpler to do. It also seems that using Math.Sqrt is quicker than using Math.Pow.
